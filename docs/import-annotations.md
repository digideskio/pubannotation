You can import annotations from an existing project.
To do so however your project has to have shared documents with the project to import annotations from.

## Using Browser GUI

1. Go to your project page.
   * top > projects > your_project
2. If you are logged in, you will find the _import_ menu in the pane, _Annotations_<br>
![import_annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/img/import_annotations.png)
3. Enter the name of the project to import annotations from.
4. Click the _import_ button.

If your project has shared documents with the project, the annotations to the documents in the project will be imported to your project.
