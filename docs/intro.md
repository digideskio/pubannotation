* *We are now working on documentation, yet it is largely incomplete.*
* *We are sorry for the inconvenience you may experience for the moment.*

<!-- ## Motivation

* It would be good if there is a portal place where we can find most of the annotations made to literature.

* It would be even better if those annotations can be accessed in various common formats.

* It would be great if combulsome problems, e.g., slight variation of text, can be systematically dealt with.

## What is PubAnnotation?

* PubAnnotation is a public repository of literature annotation where anyone can create new annotations or submit existing ones.
