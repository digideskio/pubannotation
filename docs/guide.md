*Under construction*

This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to PubAnnotation.

## Motivation

* It would be good if there is a central place where we can find annotations made to literature.

* It would be even better if those annotations can be accessed in various common formats.

* It would be great if combulsome problems, e.g., slight variation of text, can be systematically dealt with.

## What is PubAnnotation?

* PubAnnotation is a public repository of literature annotation where anyone can create new annotations or submit existing ones.
