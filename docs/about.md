## PubAnnotation

* is a **repository** of text annotation, i.e.,
  * anyone can create annotations, or
  * upload existing annotations.
* features an **text alignment** function, a.k.a, blast, so that
  * variation of text will be automatically handled when you upload your local annotations.
* is a **REST service** through which annotations are accessible to the public in various ways, e.g.,
  * annotations to the same text can be accessed collectively and selectively, even if they are produced by different groups or annotators.
* currently focuses on collecting annotations to **life science literature**:
  * [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) abstracts, and
  * [PMC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) full papers.
* is an **open source project**,
  * with its home at [GitHub](https://github.com/pubannotation/pubannotation).
* is mainly developed and maintained by **[DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp)**.
