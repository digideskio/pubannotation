Once you have [created a project]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-project/) of your own,
the next step you would like to do is to add documents to the project.

There are three ways to add documents to a project:

1. [To _add_ a document from a pre-registered database]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/add-document/), e.g. _PubMed_ or _PMC_.
2. To _import_ documents from an existing project.
3. [To _create_ a new document.]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-document/)

This page explains the second method.

You can import the documents that already in an existing project, to your project.

## Using Browser GUI

1. Go to your project page.
   * top > projects > your_project
2. If you are logged in, you will find the _import_ menu in the pane, _Documents_:<br>
![import_documents_form]({{site.baseurl}}/img/import_documents.png)
3. Enter the name of an existing project, then click the butten.
4. All the documents in the project will be imported to your project.
