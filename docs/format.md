PubAnnotation uses [JSON](http://json.org/) as its default format to contain annotations.
This document describes how annotations are represented in JSON in PubAnnotation.

PubAnnotation JSON annotation format supports three different types of information. accomodates supports three different types of annotation:

* *denotation*,
* *relation*, and
* *modification*.

## Denotation

A denotation annotation in PubAnnotation connects a span of text to a conceptual object.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![denotation example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-denotation.png)


The above example includes two denotations.
The first one states that

* An entity, *T1*, is introduced in the context.
  * `"id":"T1"`
* The span between 0'th and 5'th positions denotes the entity.
  * `"span":{"begin":0, "end":5}`
* The type of the entity is *Protein*.
  * `"obj":"Protein"`

The visualization is generated by [TextAE](http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/textae/), a default visualization and editing tool of PubAnnotation.
Note that in the visualization, labels are truncated in the end in case of insufficient space.

Denotation is the most prevalent type of annotation.

## Relation

A relation annotation relates two objects.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "interactWith", "obj": "T2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![relation example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-relation.png)

The example above states that the two entities, *T1* and *T2*, that are introduced by the two denotations,
are related to each other by the predicate, *interactWith*.
Note that the two entities are specified by the two different keys, *subj* and *obj*,
so the relation is directional.
The design is motivated for a better compatibility with [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/).

Note that PubAnnotation does not enforce any specific annotation scheme,
e.g., the labels for *obj* in denotations and those for *pred* in relations,
and it is fully up to the producer of annotation
how to design the scheme of his/her annotation.
For example, while the way of annotation in above example may be familiar to the community which seeks informatin on protein-protein interaction, another community, e.g., BioNLP Shared Task, may be more familiar with a much fine-grained annotation.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "E1", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 16}, "obj": "Expression"},
      {"id": "E2", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 38}, "obj": "Regulation"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E1"},
      {"id": "R2", "subj": "E1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E2"},
      {"id": "R3", "subj": "T2", "pred": "causeOf", "obj": "E2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Modification

A modification annotation modifies the meaning of denotations and relations, specifically in terms of negation and speculation.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "interactWith", "obj": "T2"}
   ],
   "modifications": [
      {"id": "M1", "pred": "Speculation", "obj": "R1"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![modification example]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-modification.png)

In the above example, the modification annotation, *M1*, states that the relation, *R1*, is speculative rather than declarative.
The annotation may be motivated by the word, *may*, in the sentence.
However, again, PubAnnotation does not enforce any specific annotation scheme, and actual annotation may be performed in a completely different way.

{% highlight json %}
{
   "text": "IRF-4 expression in CML may be induced by IFN-α therapy",
   "denotations": [
      {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Protein"},
      {"id": "E1", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 16}, "obj": "Expression"},
      {"id": "E2", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 38}, "obj": "Regulation"}
   ],
   "relations": [
      {"id": "R1", "subj": "T1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E1"},
      {"id": "R2", "subj": "E1", "pred": "themeOf", "obj": "E2"},
      {"id": "R3", "subj": "T2", "pred": "causeOf", "obj": "E2"}
   ],
   "modifications": [
      {"id": "M1", "pred": "Speculation", "obj": "E2"}
   ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

![modification example 2]({{ site.url }}/img/ex-modification2.png)

In the above example, 
the modification annotation, *M1*, speculates (the existence of) the entity (a regulation event), *E2*,
instead of speculating a relation.

Note that the syntax of modification annotation is experimental and subject to chanage.

What labels to use for *pred* of modification is up to the designer of annotation.
However, currently the visualiztion of [TextAE](http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/textae/) supports only *Speculation* and *Negation*.
