With PubAnnotation, beginning an annotation project is very easy, especially if want to annotate documents from pre-registered databases,
e.g., [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).

To get an idea about the process, please follow the example below:

1. make your account

To make a your own annotation project, first, you need an account at PubAnnotation.

2. create a project


3. add documents to your project

* PubAnnotation is a public repository of literature annotation where anyone can create new annotations or submit existing ones.
